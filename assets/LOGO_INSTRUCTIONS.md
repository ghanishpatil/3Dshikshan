# Logo Instructions

For the splash screen to work correctly, please follow these steps:

1. Take the 3D Shikshan logo you provided (the teal/black logo with the graduation cap and 3D printer)
2. Save it as `3dshikshan-logo.png` in this directory (F:\shikshan3D\assets\)
3. Restart the app to see the splash screen with your logo

Note: Until the logo is properly placed in this folder, the app may show an error when trying to display the splash screen.
